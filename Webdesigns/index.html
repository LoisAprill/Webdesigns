    <h1>Myself</h1> 
    <p>My name is Lois Obuobi. I am a student at KSU studying Information Technology.</p> 
    <p>I was born and raised in Ghana, West Africa. Welcome to my portfolio where I tell a little about myself.</p>
    <p>This is my first individual project and am very excited to be part of this class. </p>
    <p>I love to read fan fiction as a hobby, but my favorite subject is psychology.</p>
    <p>I am taking this class to learn about the basics of database system, which will provide a solid skill when working in my future career.</p>
