    <p>
        I like reading fanfictions. They are a unique blend of creative writing.
        Another hobby of mine is to eat and read when i have free time.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a fun way to connect, explore and dive deeper into the fictional
        world.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to work as a full-stack developer after graduation. I'm also
        interested in pursuing a master's degree in Data Science.
    </p>
    <p>Essentially, this is my first individual project.</p>
    <p>
        I am at KSU majoring in Information technology. I also have a passion for
        web development and data science.
